<h2>Warning â€” Unpatched Critical 'Wormable'</h2> 
                </pre>

                <h6>March 11, 2020</h6>
                <p>Hello bright cyberers,</p>

                <p> Shortly after releasing its monthly batch of security updates, Microsoft late yesterday separately
                    issued an advisory warning billions of its Windows users of a new critical, unpatched, and wormable
                    vulnerability affecting Server Message Block 3.0 (SMBv3) network communication protocol.
                    It appears Microsoft originally planned to fix the flaw as part of its March 2020 Patch Tuesday
                    update only, but, for some reason, it pulled the plug at the last minute, which apparently did not
                    stop a tech company from accidentally leaking the existence of the unpatched flaw.</p><br>
                <p>
                    The yet-to-be patched flaw (tracked as CVE-2020-0796), if exploited successfully, could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target SMB Server or SMB Client.
The belated acknowledgment from Microsoft led some researchers to call the bug "SMBGhost."
