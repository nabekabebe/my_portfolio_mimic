                                            Computers have become mandatory to run a successful businesses. It is not
                                            enough to have isolated computers systems; they need to be networked to
                                            facilitate communication with external businesses. This exposes them to the
                                            outside world and hacking. Hacking means using computers to commit
                                            fraudulent acts such as fraud, privacy invasion, stealing corporate/personal
                                            data, etc.

                                            year. Businesses need to protect themselves against such attacks.
                                            Hacking is identifying weakness in computer systems or networks to exploit
                                            its weaknesses to gain access. Example of Hacking: Using password cracking
